# Flight-Data-Analysis
### In this project,we developed an Oozie workflow to process and analyze a large volume of flight data in a Fully Distributed Mode in Hadoop.
â€¢ Instructions;
- Install Hadoop/Oozie on your Google Cloud Platform.
- Downloaded the Airline On-time Performance data set (flight data set) from the period of
 October 1987 to April 2008 on the Statistical Computing website: http://statcomputing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html
- Designed, implemented, and ran an Oozie workflow to find out
a. the 3 airlines with the highest and lowest probability, respectively, for being on
schedule;
b. the 3 airports with the longest and shortest average taxi time per flight (both in and
out), respectively; and
c. the most common reason for flight cancellations.
